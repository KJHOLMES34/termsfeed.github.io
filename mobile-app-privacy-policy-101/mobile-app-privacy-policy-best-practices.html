                        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
                        
                        <p><strong>Here are a few best practices to follow for your mobile app Privacy Policy:</strong></p>

                        <ul>

                        <li><p>Have Good Privacy Practices in Place</p>

                        <p>While having a good Privacy Policy is important, it will only be as good as your actual privacy practices are. Your app needs to take privacy seriously.</p>

                        <ul>
                        <li>Only collect personal information and data that you actually need</li>
                        <li>Have security measures in place for protecting data</li>
                        <li>Have a plan in place for how to handle a data security breach</li>
                        </ul>

                        </li>

                        <li><p>Be Accurate</p>

                        <p>Your Privacy Policy must accurately reflect what you do. Update it as needed if you change your privacy practices, start using collected information in new ways or change your security approach.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Be Clear and Concise</p>

                        <p>Your Privacy Policy must be written in language that's easy to understand by your average reader.</p>

                        <p>Use <strong>short, clear sentences</strong> and explain things when needed. Not everyone knows what a cookie or web beacon is, or why a third party would be used for analytics.</p>

                        <p>Try to find a balance between being short and to the point, while also being as informative as possible.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Make it Always Accessible</p>

                        <p>Your Privacy Policy must always be accessible.</p>

                        <p>If you use the <a href="https://termsfeed.com/privacy-policy/generator/">TermsFeed Privacy Policy Generator</a>, you can host your Policy for free through TermsFeed and it will always be there when your users click your Privacy Policy link.</p></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h2>Summary</h2>

                        <p><strong>A Privacy Policy is legally required around the world if your app collects and uses personal information</strong>. App stores also often require you to include one in your app as well as in the app store listing page. Third party services commonly require them as well.</p>

                        <p>Creating a Privacy Policy is relatively easy, as is adding it to your app and to app store listings.</p>

                        <p>Focus on informing users about:</p>

                        <ul>
                        <li>What types of information you collect</li>
                        <li>How you collect it</li>
                        <li>How you use it</li>
                        <li>How you protect it</li>
                        <li>If you share it with third parties</li>
                        <li>Any options users have for opting out of collection, changing their information and other ways they can control what's done with their personal information</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Write your Privacy Policy in a way that's easy to read and understand, and make it always accessible.</p>

                        <p>This will keep your users happy and keep you compliant with third party requirements and international laws.</p>
